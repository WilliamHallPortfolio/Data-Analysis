## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel to provide a comprehensive view of MTA ridership patterns and fare evasion trends. The dashboard provides visual insights into system-wide data and supports key stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

---

## Motivation

This project examines NYC’s subway and bus transportation system’s total ridership and fare evasion rates since recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying ridership patterns and understanding how to curtail fare evasion can help transit authorities enhance service and mitigate revenue losses.

Key objectives include:
- Displaying total ridership trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Highlighting fare evasion rates by months, years, and by quarter.
- Examining the correlation between ridership and fare evasion.
- Supporting data-driven decision-making for Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) initiatives.

---

## Data Sources

The following datasets were used in the analysis:
- **MTA_Bus_Fare_Evasion__Beginning_2019**: Reports MTA bus ridership and fare evasion rates.
- **MTA_Monthly_Ridership___Traffic_Data__Beginning_January_2008**: Reports system-wide ridership totals for all MTA agencies. 
- **MTA_Summonses_and_Arrests__Beginning_2019**: Reports on monthly summons and arrests for fare evasion and other violations.

---

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
- Imported data into Microsoft Excel.
- Cleaned and formatted datasets to ensure consistency.
- Combined related sources to one Excel workbook "NYCT Fare Evasion Project.xlsx".
- Created calculated columns and adjusted row sizes to match table dimensions.

### Data Visualization
- Used pivot tables and charts to visualize trends and find correlations between ridership and fare evasion.
- Implemented slicers and filters for interactive exploration.

---
## Key Findings

- **Ridership Trends**: Overall ridership has yet to rebound to pre-COVID levels after several years.
- **Fare Evasion information**: Subway fare evasion has near-doubled since first recovering from the pandemic.
- **Correlation**: Determined that correlation is present between "Theft of Service TAB Summons" and overall subway ridership. Something that must be investigated further.

---

## Dashboard Features

- **Filters**: Interactive slicers for filtering by violation metrics.
- **Trend Visualizations**: Line charts showing ridership trends over time.
- **Fare Evasion Comparison**: Bar charts comparing fare evasion rates across bus and subway systems.

---

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- **Microsoft Excel 2016 or later**

### Viewing the Dashboard
1. Download the project files by cloning the repository:
2. Open the `NYCT Fare Evasion Project.xlsx' file in Microsoft Excel.
3. Use the slicers and filters to explore the data interactively.
